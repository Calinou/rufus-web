<h1>NO, I do NOT need an akeo.ie web site redesign or Search Engine Optimization</h1>
<ul>
<li>I very much like the site as it is (for more reasons than meet the eye) and I'm very happy with its current places in search engines.</li>
<li>I don't believe every web site has to be a showcase for the ever evolving "modern" design technologies. For more on this, see <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">here</a>.</li>
<li>I do not want to put additional strain on the server, its security, the translators or even myself, by introducing unneeded changes.</li>
<li>In case you haven't noticed, this is NOT a commercial web site. The reason it is popular is precisely <b>because</b> there is nothing to sell or to monetize.</li>
<li>As such, I have exactly $0.00 to spend for redesign/SEO.</li>
<li>If your end goal was to make money off this site, please do your research next time, instead of sending yet another generic e-mail about how I can <i>"improve my online sales"</i>...</li>
<li>As long as visitors can get to the information I placed here (and the server stats show they have no problem doing so), the website is good enough and in no need of any changes.</li>
<li>Thanks for the offer &amp; have a nice day.</li>
</ul>
