<title>Thank you for your offer</title>
<body>
<h1>Sorry but I have to reject your offer...</h1>
<ul>
<li>I receive a request to redesign the Rufus web site every other week (hence this generic page) so, first of all, you should realise that the chances that I am somehow going to accept <b>your</b> proposal and not the many ones I have received before is incredibly slim.</li>
<li>I also receive requests to use a new logo for Rufus about once every month, with the same caveat as above.<br/>Please be very mindful that I am <b>NOT</b> planning to change the Rufus logo, ever, and that the only logo "improvement" I will ever accept is if you somehow manage to produce an SVG version, free of rights, that looks as close as possible to the current logo.</li>
<li>I don't accept unsolicited work, period.<br/>Therefore, If you didn't ask me <b>beforehand</b> whether I am open to redesigning the web site, your offer will be rejected, plain and simple, no matter how great it may look.</li>
<li>If you do bother to ask me beforehand, I will tell you that the <b>only</b> redesign that I have in mind for this web site is one that relies on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll">switching to Jekyll</a>. Therefore, if your proposal is not based on using GitHub pages and Jekyll, I will simply reject it.</li>
<li>However, I am only going to move to Jekyll generated content when <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/401">this issue</a> (that has been opened for more than 4 years now, with no sign of progress) has been resolved, since I need localisation support (and, no, I don't want to go through generating localised pages locally as a workaround). Which means that, until that happens, the web page will remain exactly as it stands today.</li>
<li>I also very much want to keep the Rufus homepage as accessible as possible, and I don't think forcing users to navigate between multiple screens is ever going to help with that.</li>
<li>I do not want to put additional strain on the site, its security, its maintainabiliity, the translators or even myself, by introducing unwarranted changes.</li>
<li>I don't believe every web site has to be a <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">showcase for the latest web technologies</a>.<br/>Especially as long as visitors can easily access to the information I place here (and the lack of feedback I get on data being hard to access shows that all the information they want is easy enough to access), I consider that the site is more than good enough and does not need a redesign.</li>
<li>As much as you feel the need to grow your "portfolio" I would really appreciate if you didn't try to use this web site to do so, thank you.</li>
